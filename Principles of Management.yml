  Types of strategies:
    Strategic Controls:
      very broad:
        Am I winning this?
        Are we profitable?
      described in a strategic plan
      like broad strategies in a chess game
      big picture
    Tactical Controls:
      short term plans
      more flexible
      constantly changing as plans are created and then finished or discarded
  goals that are difficult to measure are also difficult to control
  planning and control work together

  Organizational chart:
    communication and thinking tool on organizational structures
    Line Staff:
      also called:
        Pyramid Organization
        Hierarchical Organization
      single exec at top with various growing layers of management and staff
      represents both authority and communication
      HR tends to be outside pyramid
      distinguishes between staff functions and management functions
      Organization Designs:
        Functional Organization:
          people are grouped into suborganizations based on function
          would be split into groups like
          groups: [finance, marketing, production]
          values efficiency over productivity
        Product Organization:
          people are organized by the product that they help produce
          each suborganization has its own finance, marketing, and production
          the manager of each suborganization is more akin to a ceo than a manager, sharing many of the same responsibilities
          popular with differentiated competetors
          allows for smoother interfacing with customers
          each mini-ceo generates profit and loss evaluations
        Geographic Organization:
          organized by the physical location of each suborganization
          tend to be split up by various markets, like North America, Asia, Europe
          very popular with diverse international companies
          typically done with differentiated competetors
          customers in one country could have completely different wants and needs as customers in another country
          laws can vary drastically from country to country
  Planning always comes first
