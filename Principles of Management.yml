3.4:
  Types of strategies:
    Strategic Controls:
      very broad:
        Am I winning this?
        Are we profitable?
      described in a strategic plan
      like broad strategies in a chess game
      big picture
    Tactical Controls:
      short term plans
      more flexible
      constantly changing as plans are created and then finished or discarded
  goals that are difficult to measure are also difficult to control
  planning and control work together
